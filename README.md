# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


## This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  
`npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.  

The page will reload if you make edits.  

You will also see any lint errors in the console.  


`npm test` 

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  

Refer to the section on running tests for more information.  


`npm run build`  

Builds the app for production in the build folder.  

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.  


The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.  

Your app is ready to be deployed!  


Refer to the section on deployment for more information.  


`npm run eject` 

Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!  

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.  

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and their transitive dependencies (such as webpack, Babel, and ESLint) directly into your project, giving you full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you’re on your own.  

You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and medium deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
